This is graphic user interface for remote control car that I build based on rapberry pi, and pololu motors and hat.  
- GUI shows video image from the camera.  
- You can control car by joistick (meant for touch screens, but can be used with mouse), or by keyboard.  
- There are two buttons - to capture videos and take photos.  
- There are bars that shows car speeds for both wheels - green to red for forward movements, and blue to violet for backward.  

User input is converted into two values from -1 to 1 coresponding to speeds of two motors, so you can easily adapt it to your project.
